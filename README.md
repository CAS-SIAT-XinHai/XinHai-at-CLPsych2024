# XinHai at CLPsych2024
Our code for CLPsych 2024 Shared Task Utilising LLMs: Finding supporting evidence about an individualâ€™s suicide risk level

## Methodology
Our system integrates fine-tuned LLMs, employing Chain of Thought and one-shot learning techniques to enhance the model's ability to extract and summarize relevant evidence. For details on our methodology, refer to our model pipeline diagram. ![Model Pipeline](pipeline.jpg)
